# Description

The [ISCCâ€“NBS System of Color Designation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCC%E2%80%93NBS_system) is a
system for naming colors based on a set of 12 basic color terms and a small set of adjective modifiers.
This system formally defines a set of non-technical color names as a subset of the
[Munsell System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system).

I was curious about using this in some data analysis, but I was unable to find a description
of the ISCC-NBS system's [color lookup tables](doc/color_name_charts.md) in machine-readable format, so I've transcribed
the information out of [NBS Special Publication 440 "Color: Universal Language and Dictionary of Names" by Kenneth L. Kelly and Deane B. Judd](https://archive.org/details/coloruniversalla00kell/)
into an XML-based document that can be used as an input source for any programming language
for which libraries dealing with Munsell notation exist (for example, [Colour for Python](https://www.colour-science.org/)).
